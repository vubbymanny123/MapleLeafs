 With the NHL officially beginning in 1917, the Toronto Maple Leafs were one of the teams across Canada.
 The NHL officially started off with 5 teams, but reduced to 3 after Quebec and the Montreal Wanderers 
 had to leave due to financial troubles. Toronto too, was on the verge of financial crisis, and help
 finally came as the owners of the Ontario Hockey Association helped create the Toronto St.Pats. This 
 team was created to bring the large population on Irish citizens to the games. However, the owner 
 eventually lost a lawsuit and had to sell the team. A company from Philadelphia wanted to buy it, but 
 former Canadian military officer Conn Smythe submitted an offer of $160,000 that the owners agreed to. 
 Conn Smythe renamed the team to the “Maple Leafs” and changed the colors back to Blue and White. In 
 1931, the Leafs debuted at the newly constructed Maple Leaf Gardens. The Leafs reached the cup finals 5/7
 times the next couple years, and this begun the start of their successful career. When the NHL was expanded 
 in 1942, to the Original 6, the Maple Leafs started out as an incredible force. They won 4 cups that decade
 and surpassed the Montreal Canadiens as the most Stanley Cups in history. In 1960, Conn Smythe sold 
 the team for $2,300,000. The Leafs went on to win another trio of Stanley Cups that decade. In 1990, the
 Leafs made an incredible rebuild and the team was full of stars and franchise players. With an outstandingly 
 talented team, the Leafs made the conference finals but lost to the LA Kings, but not without controversy.
 The Leafs were leading 3-2 in the series, and in the final moments, Wayne Gretzky accidentally hit Doug
 Gilmour in the face with the stick. The referee however didn’t call a penalty on the play. Moments later,
 Gretzky scored the game winner and LA would come back to win the series. In 2003, the Leafs made the
 playoffs, but were quickly succumbed by the Philadelphia Flyers in 7 games. The rest however, has become
 history.
